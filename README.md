News Article Topic Modeling
===========================

Overview
--------

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing an unsupervised machine learning approach, specifically matrix factorization (NMF - Non-negative Matrix Factorization), to extract meaningful topics from a dataset of news articles. The project utilizes labels solely for evaluating the accuracy of the unsupervised model.

Methodology
-----------

-   Data preprocessing using TF-IDF Vectorization

-   Dimensionality reduction and topic extraction using NMF

-   Evaluation of topic coherence

-   Validation against labeled data (accuracy is for validation purposes only)

Results
-------

The notebook outputs:

-   Identified topics with their top keywords

-   Visualization of topic distribution

-   Accuracy metrics for validation against true labels
